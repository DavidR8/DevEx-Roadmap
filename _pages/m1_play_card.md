title: Our Multi-Modal Governance Play Card
---

With the guiding principles defined below in-hand, decision-makers participating within the Investment Board, the TS Investment Working Group, the emerging TS Portfolio Management Board and the under-development TS Architecture Review Board will have the customer-focus lens they require to:

* Base their decisions related to IT product and service design and development on the needs and expectations of those who TS serves, and with whom it partners and works

* Establish evaluation criteria for proposed designs and Concept Cases − and optimally understand, anticipate and influence customer demand for new TS products and services

* Effectively review, prioritize and approve requests for new TS products and services − ensuring that decisions on TS product and service investments align with approved strategic direction

* Leverage the blended advantages of both traditional waterfall planning *and* agile scrum – and effectively and quickly react to unexpected, if not on occasion catastrophic events

* Apply the correct mix of resources, processes and enabling architectures to efficiently allocate scarce government funding to activities that generate greatest gain and value − and alleviate greatest pain and risk, at lowest cost and complexity, and in the shortest amount of time
