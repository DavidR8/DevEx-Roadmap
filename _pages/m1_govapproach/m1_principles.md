title: Guiding Principles
---

At TS, we are uncovering bold and better ways of designing, developing and enhancing our products and services for the betterment of those we serve, and with whom we partner and work.

We are doing this by embracing innovation and risk, by accepting that periodic failure is normal, and by just getting on with the continuous and iterative improvement of our efforts and investments.

Through this lens, our staff have come to value:

* People and just doing the work, over processes and tools

* Working products and services, over comprehensive documentation

* Co-creation and collaboration with customers over, contract negotiation

* Responding to necessary change and disruption, over the rote execution of a plan

When we make decisions and approve investments with respect to the design, development and enhancement of our IT products and services we constantly ask ourselves these defining questions:

`1. Should we invest in this? 

`2. Do we have the resources? 

`3. Are we building it right?

> > *This means never taking on the design or development of an IT product or service at TS unless we are able to do it the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right people and the right tools and processes.*

`4. Is our highest priority to satisfy customers through early and continuous delivery of value-creating products and services?

> > *This means getting something workable and immediately effective into the hands of the customer as quickly as possible, and making necessary final adjustments to it after, or even during, initial delivery.*

`5. Will we, at all times, welcome changing requirements, even late in development?

> > *This means being driven by what the customer actually needs and expects, and not by what the original design specifications had said.*

`6. Will we deliver iterations of our products and services frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter lifecycle?

> > *This means external customer success trumps internal design perfection.*

`7. Are we co-creating products and services alongside customers?

> > *This means engaging customers directly in the design process, ensuring that the features and functionality of IT products and services reflect real-world use vs. abstract interpretation of design blueprints.*

`8. Will we design, develop and enhance products and services around highly motivated staff? Will we give them the tools, the data, the funding, the architectures, the risk tolerance, the insights, and the leadership supports they require? Do we trust them to get the job done?**

> > *This means equipping our own people with what they actually require to excel at customer success. *

`9. Are ‘working products and services’ our primary measure of success?

> > *This means we value customer success more than we celebrate compliance with processes.*

`10. Do we recognize that *the* most efficient and effective method of conveying information to, and within, a development team is through face-to-face interaction?

> > *This means breaking old habits: spending more time talking to people in-person than we do using devices and electronically processing words in isolation.*

`11.  Will we embrace simplicity: the essential art of maximizing the least amount of work done?

> > *This means being happy with what works.*

`12. Do we recognize that the very best requirements, architectures and designs emerge form self-organizing teams?

> > *This means giving competent staff clarity of design purpose, minimum specifications, and the freedom to figure it all out on their own through trial and error, free of judgement and micromanagement.*

`13.  Are we reflecting frequently, and at regular intervals, on how our development teams can become more effective and adjust its behaviour accordingly?

> > *This means constant judgement-free reflection on what could have been done differently or better.*

The wording of these questions will be further refined in subsequent product versions of this guide.
