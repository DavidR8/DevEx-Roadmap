title: Goverance Approach
---

The purpose of this section is to define the approach to governance for IT product and service design at TS.

###Assumptions

* The terms of reference for the TS Investment Board (TSIB) is both robust and complete: it already addresses all of the critical considerations that would otherwise go into a standalone governance model for IT product and service design and development at TS

* The governance model that has been developed for the TS Investment Working Group (TSIWG), along with those being contemplated for both the TS Portfolio Management Board (TSPMB) and the TS Architecture Review Board (TSARB) will similarly address ‘like’ critical considerations

* All of these existing and under-contemplation governance frameworks also adequately address business drivers, business problems and opportunities, and clarity of business purpose: each makes clear that governance is about executive accountability for results (the ends), managerial responsibility for performance (the means) and staff commitment to excellence (the enablers)

* Each specifies roles, responsibilities, accountabilities and authorities: each speaks to new behaviour, measurements of success, and operating structures, processes and mechanisms

Thus, the creation of an elaborate, standalone and redundant governance framework for IT product and service design, development and enhancement at TS is not necessary.

What is actually required to have effective governance for IT product and service design and development at TS is the introduction and use of a multi-modal play card that defines a set of simple and clear guiding principles that align with both the global ITIL standard *and* the proven principles of agile product and service development that come to us from the [Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) that has been embraced by leading IT provisioners all across the globe.
