title: IT Product and Service Design Process Map
---

The intent of this initiative is to build upon and enhance the good work that was previously done by TS with the assistance from external experts. Earlier versions of IT product and service design process maps were reviewed in detail and used as the foundation for this work.

##The Phases

Through collaboration within TS and with external stakeholders, it has been determined that the enhanced approach should follow four interconnected phases:

* Initiation
* Early Design & Coordination
* Design & Development
* Transition

These phases should be guided by two dimensions of governance:

* Behavioural
* Structural

The enhanced IT Product and Service Design Process Map is shown in  Figure 6. The map has been developed in an iterative manner and has been guided by numerous workshops and interviews with TS stakeholders.

The map is divided into four integrated and connected phases. All four phases are guided by behavioural governance principles and supported by structural governance through Technology Solutions Investment Board (TSIB), Portfolio Management Board (PMB) and Architecture Review Board (ARB). A description of each phase is presented below.

###Suggested Roles:

* Business partner: A potential consumer of the new product or service

* Sponsor: The individual who is responsible for the funding of the effort

* Coordinator: an individual who is responsible for ensuring that all stakeholders are kept up-to-date on progress and are kept engaged in the efforts

* Product owner: a TS individual or organization that will manage the product or service once it goes live

* Technical lead: the individual within a Service Delivery Unit most impacted by the change

* Design and development team members: individuals who will participate in the design and/or development
