title: Code With Us / Pay 4 Pull
---

1. As a developer, I want to easily contribute work to BC Public Sector programs so that I can be paid, help improve services and contribute to my community while focusing on writing code rather than procurement paperwork. 

2. As a program owner, I want to obtain and pay for the contributions from developers so that I can improve my programs and services faster and easier than using traditional procurement methods.
