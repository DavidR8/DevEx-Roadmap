Title: Behavioural and Structural Governance
---

A critical consideration of the enhanced IT product and service design and development process is ensuring that governance is embedded within it. Governance will not be effective unless it is integrated with all four stages of the design process.

For the purposes of this guide, structural governance is defined as the governance bodies, models, and processes that promote executive accountability for effectiveness and results, and enable managerial responsibility for efficiency and performance, as well as TS staff commitment to design and development excellence. Shown in Box B in Figure 7 below, structural governance provides a foundation for the four stages of the design process. Conversely, behavioural governance (Box A below) guides the relationships between key stakeholders involved in the process and encourages desirable behaviours across the organization.
