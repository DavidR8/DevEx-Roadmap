### What is the BCDevExchange

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

The BCDevExchange is experimenting with new ways for tech innovators and government to work together, grow B.C.’s economy, and make services for British Columbians better.

To build better technology services and help B.C.’s tech industry grow we are:

- Creating new, faster, streamlined ways for the public sector to acquire software from the tech community.

- Matching the business needs of government organizations in B.C. with innovations from B.C.’s technology industry.

- Sharing government digital resources – code, data and APIs – that entrepreneurs can use to seed their businesses.  

</div>

### Why are we sharing our roadmap

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

We are building in partnership with our user community – the developers, app builders, startups and public sector innovators - who we expect to use the BCDevExchange.

Early on we heard from B.C.’s tech community that we should not build the BCDevExchange in isolation, advice we have taken to heart. 

That is why everything we do is in the open. From the beginning we published the open source code that powers the BCDevExchange app in GitHub, the popular online code sharing platform. 

We are now sharing our 2016/17 service roadmap as part of our concerted effort to engage with B.C.’s tech community to help shape, refine and contribute to the development of the BCDevExchange. 

We invite you to see what we’re doing and tell us your opinion and advice on how we should provide business value to our user community.

</div>

### Where did the roadmap come from

<div class="page-section">

The BCDevExchange follows the Agile Methodology. We build, test and refine based on our user’s feedback to ensure we deliver value to our users. 

The content of this roadmap was derived through the work with did with our community last year, and may change based on further interactions with our community this year. 

To create the roadmap, we first examined our research findings on common business needs in the community. We then determined how we could meet those business needs with a range of services which you will find in this roadmap.  

We realized business needs could be themed into cultural, process and technological transformations; the collective objective being to accelerate the speed of value delivery and increase the quality at a code base level.

</div>

### How to use this roadmap

<div class="page-section">

In broad terms, this roadmap describes the potential services of the BCDevExchange. These are the, Epics – our big pieces of work – for this fiscal year (2016/2017).

For each Epic there is a high-level user story and the stages we will follow, beginning with customer discovery and user research.

If you would like more detail, each Epic gets further broken down into smaller user stories which can be viewed and commented on in our Kanban boards. At the smaller user story level, you can find and explore the tasks and associated artifacts related to each story.

These Kanban boards organize our user stories into our product backlog, work underway during our current two-week development sprint, and a work already completed in the done column.

</div>

### How to contribute

<div class="page-section">

We encourage you to explore, examine and share your ideas as we are always looking for input that will help us provide the most user value.

<!-- / INTRODUCTION -->
<!-- KICKSTART -->
<h2 id="Kick_Start">Kick Start Your First Release</h2>

### What is Kick Start

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

The BCDevExchange is experimenting with how we deliver IT projects. The concept is to deliver faster and continuous user value with new tools and methods. This year we are looking for a few government projects to run through our ‘Kick Start Your First Release’ service. Instead of packaging many features into a once or thrice a year release, we will help these projects release features continuously, on a two to three week sprint schedule following an Agile Methodology. Features released will be informed by user research and the code created will be open source, providing opportunities for collaboration with entrepreneurs, companies and startups in the B.C. tech sector. These projects will also follow the DevOps approach. See Code For Government Ready Products for more info.

</div>

### User Story - epic

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}

<div class="page-section">

#### As a **public sector program owner**...

I should be able to sponsor my first ever continuous service improvement initiative...

using the agile methodology, UX/human centered service design, open design/development, and devOps...

with the assistance of a ready-made program that will train my staff and connect with entrepreneurs and developers...

so that I have tangible results within 6-9 months and a functional, complete, team that can sustain the initiative into future years.

<!-- SPRINT WITH US -->
<h2 id="Sprint_With_Us">Sprint With Us</h2>

### What is Sprint With Us

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

Government IT projects that use Agile Methodology may discover that they need to rapidly bring new people and skills onto their sprint team. The value of Agile is the ability to pivot and go in a new direction based on research with your user community. A change in direction may mean you need to add different skills and expertise to your Agile team. Waiting weeks to procure a new contractor could pose risks to keeping a project on the sprint schedule. ‘Sprint with Us’ is a concept for a new procurement model that allows projects to rapidly scale up their sprint teams.

</div>

### User Story - epic

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

#### As a **public sector program owner**...

I should be able to field up to 50% of my sprint team (2-4 team members) from a team that is operating in the private sector...

in a near-instant manner and continue that engagement as long as it is needed...

so that I can quickly, and continuously, improve my program and its services.

----

#### As a **small team of skilled individuals** operating in the private sector...

I should be able to join a sprint team for a BC public sector program owner...

in a near-instant manner and be able to continue the engagement as long as it is needed...

so I can help them quickly and continuously improve their program and its services.

<!-- CODE FOR GOVERNMENT READY PRODUCTS -->
<h2 id="Code4Gov">Code for Government Ready Products</h2>

### What is Code For Gov Ready Products

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

Code for Government Ready products is the business process and tech stack - think DevOps and automated tool chains – to make continuous release possible. In order to successfully do continuous release projects need to break down the silos between those who develop the code, and those who operate the system. We will pilot the DevOps approach within the B.C. public sector, bringing the code developers and operations staff together on one team. To make this all work we are exploring an automated tool chain, a variety of tools in the marketplace that when combined make it possible to rapidly deploy code from the dev environment to the production environment.  The end goal is to make it easier to collaborate with entrepreneurs, companies and startups in the B.C. tech sector.

We will share parts of this tech stack with the B.C. tech community so that we can rapidly adopt their technical solutions.

</div>

### User Story - epic

### What is Pay 4 Pull

{::options parse_block_html="true" /}
<div class="page-section">

Pay for Pull’ is an experimental procurement model to explore new ways we could attract developers to work on public sector tech challenges. We create an issue in GitHub, the popular code sharing platform, and label it with ‘Help Wanted” and ‘$1000’. In the issue we will explain what we want done, sparking conversation between government technical staff and developers interested in doing the work. Interested developers can do the work and send us their code in GitHub – using a pull request. If we accept the code, we pay the developer $1000 via PayPal.
