title: Plan for fiscal year 2016/17
---

The BCDevExchange has set out the following goals for the 2016/17 fiscal year:

- Confirm a single sector and support that sector and its technology industry in successfully creating two new industry products and services.
- Continue to enhance the BCDevExchange platform to introduce new features and new procurement 
methods that support larger units of value exchange.
- Expand the number of early adopter public sector organizations participating in BCDevExchange by registering at least 3 new partners.

The key activities to support these goals are as follows:

Assess the potential for selecting a single sector to focus on and if warranted support that sector and its technology industry to successfully create bi-directional value. The candidate sectors that have been identified to-date include:

- Transportation – within the BCDevExchange there are a number of resources related to roads 
and traffic and public transport, e.g. transportation digital resources, webcams, a geocoder API, 
road events API, etc.   At the March 16, 2016 Discovery Day, significant interest was shown in 
the transportation opportunities by Translink, the cities of Surrey and Vancouver, and the 
Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure.  There is evidence from the transportation 
technology industry that there are opportunities for product development and tech sector 
growth.
- Natural Resources – this sector is a priority initiative of government and IM/IT Transformation.  
There are opportunities for Natural Resources development and extraction and with them there 
is a history of companies being founded on the basis of their engagement with public sector 
organizations.  The Federal government qualified the opportunity to be a $2.5 billion to GDP on 
a yearly basis.
- Real Estate – the initial engagement with BC Assessment (BCA) and the technology industry has 
highlighted significant interest in access to BCA’s digital resources.  Twenty five firms have 
expressed direct interest through participation in a Discovery Day event.   
Ministry of Technology Innovation and Citizen Services

Expand the services of the BCDevExchange platform: 

- Scale and enhance the Rapid Adoption features to accommodate increased Pay for Pull 
capabilities and other new procurement methods that can enable the exchange of larger units 
of value, and allow the public sector partners to become positive reference customers for B.C.’s 
technology entrepreneurs. 
- Implement a test lab to facilitate a shared collaboration, co-design and co-development
environment.
- Enhance API listing services to include developer registration, security keys and more robust 
terms of use and service. 
- Introduce data analytics as another digital resource type.

Continue Communication and Stakeholder Engagement:

- Develop, manage and implement a 2016/17 Stakeholder Engagement and Communication Plan 
using multiple channels to create awareness and understanding of the BCDevExchange and 
connect partners and industry in meaningful ways.
- Continue to leverage technology accelerators and technology industry communities to reach 
wider circles of software developers

Implement a Cultural Change approach:
 
- Develop, manage and implement a change management plan to increase readiness levels with 
partners and selected sector clients and bring about the cultural shift necessary to support the 
adoption and adaptation to BCDevExchange principles.
