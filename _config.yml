Update the config file
Work your way through these steps to update the _config.yml file â€” this configures the 18F style template for your specific guide:

Set the guide name.
Set the exclude: entries.
Register pages in the navigation bar.
Update the repository list.
Optional: Set the back_link: property.
Optional: Update google_analytics_ua:.
Set the guide name

The name: property appears as the guide's overall title. For example:

name: IT Product and Service Design Guide
Set the exclude: entries

Make sure the exclude: list contains at least the following files, and add any other files you might have added that shouldn't appear in the generated _site directory:

exclude:
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- Gemfile
- Gemfile.lock
- LICENSE.md
- README.md
- go
- vendor
Register pages in the navigation bar

The navigation: list generates the table of contents. For example, the navigation: section of this guide contains:

navigation:
- text: About This Guide
  url: m1_about/
  internal: true
- text: The Problem
  url: m1_theproblem/
  internal: true
  #- text: The Opportunity
  #url: m1_theopportunity/
  #internal: true
#- text: The Solution
#  url: m1_thesolution/
#  internal: true
#- text: The Maturity Model
#  url: m1_maturitymodel/
#  internal: true
#- text: The Design Process Map
#  url: m1_processmap/
#  internal: true
